**Angular.js + jQuery Text Adventure Framework**

*Within a day, this text-adventure framework was born!*

**Current features:**
  * Stat Handling
  * Grid-based Map Movement/Creation
  * Deep Room Customization (The sky is the limit if you have solid Javascript skills)
  * World Persistance 

Everything is open source and I will be periodically updating this with additions, revisions, and completely new features.

The next day is going to be solely dedicated to finishing up the actual game -I'M- going to be making with this, but after that I'll try to resolve any major issues and move forward from there!

**Thanks for readings/building/playing!**

I enjoy friendly conversations, so feel free to tweet [@defacid](http://twitter.com/defacid) and I'll be sure to at least say hi!
